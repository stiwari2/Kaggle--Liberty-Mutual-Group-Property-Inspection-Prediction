## Kaggle--Liberty-Mutual-Group-Property-Inspection-Prediction
To ensure that Liberty Mutualâ€™s portfolio of home insurance policies aligns with their business goals, many newly insured properties receive a home inspection. These inspections review the condition of key attributes of the property, including things like the foundation, roof, windows and siding. The results of an inspection help Liberty Mutual determine if the property is one they want to insure.

In this challenge, your task is to predict a transformed count of hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset of property information. This will enable Liberty Mutual to more accurately identify high risk homes that require additional examination to confirm their insurability.
