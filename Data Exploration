## Data Exploration and Key Statistics
Each row of predictor x has a Hazard score i.e y. Hazard score indicates the pre-exisiting damages in the house. Low hazard value means less hazards and vice versa

Training and Testing dataset have 
- 51,000 records
- 32 predictors - 16 categorial + 16  numeric
- Categorial predictors have values upto 18 levels
- Hazard score from 1 to 69

Mean hazard score- 4.02
Median hazard score - 3
Data follows a long tail distribution. 80% of the records have hazard value less than 8. 
So, we are dealing with highly imbalanced problem. We would need to deal with categorial variables
